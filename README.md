This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Python. It is a console-based two-player game where Player X and Player O take turns marking spaces on a 3Ã—3 grid. The game checks for winning conditions after every move and declares the winner if a player manages to place three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If all the cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. This project demonstrates basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, lists, and functions.
